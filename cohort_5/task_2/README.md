## Task 2: Encoding and Classifier

The task is to contruct a classifier for samples described by 4 numerical features for each sample. The task includes applying several different data embedding schemes, designing a variational quantum circuit, building a classifier, training it and analyzing the results.

The solution is presented in the jupyter notebook [task_2.ipynb](https://github.com/dmburd/QOSF_Mentorship_Program/blob/main/cohort_5/task_2/task_2.ipynb).
